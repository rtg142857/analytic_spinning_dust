# analytic_spinning_dust
This repository contains code used for A. Menegas et al.'s Analytic Approximations of Rotating Interstellar Dust Spectral Energy Distributions.

The file 'SpDust changes' details the changes that were made to the Ali-Ha√Ømoud et al.'s SpDust program in order to make it produce SEDs representative of dust clouds which had their distributions of charge, size, shape and/or dipole moment replaced with delta functions.

idealplots.py contains the code that was used to produce Figures 1-5.

j3j4plots.py contains the code that was used to produce Figures 6-14.

doublegoodness.py contains the code that was used to produce Figure 15.

goodnessoffit.py contains the code that was used to produce Tables 2-6.
