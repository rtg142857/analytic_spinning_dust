# analytic_spinning_dust
This repository contains code used for A. Menegas et al.'s Analytic Approximations of Rotating Interstellar Dust Spectral Energy Distributions.

The folder labeled 'Python Programs' contains the programs that were used to find analytic functions that approximated the radiation curves, as well as those that produced the plots used in the paper. The file 'SpDust changes' details the changes that were made to the Ali-Ha√Ømoud et al.'s SpDust program.

idealplots.py contains the code that was used to produce figures 1-5.

j3j4plots.py contains the code that was used to produce figures 6-14.
